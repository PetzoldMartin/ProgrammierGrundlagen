Skill and Item Tags - Insert the following tags into Skill or Item noteboxes.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# <area radius: x>
# For those who want their skills to have AoE effects but not target everything,
# you can set the pixel radius with x and the skill will target units within
# that marked area. Note that area of effect targetting does not apply to
# Lunatic Mode to maintain custom control. You'll have to manually enter it in
# if you wish for area of effect targetting. Selection typical is elliptical.
# 
# <area height: x%>
# By default, x is 33% allowing for a small height radius when selecting your
# targets. However, some skills can target higher than normal so use this to
# adjust it accordingly. For ellipitical selection type.
# 
# <area image: phrase>
# Those that want to change the area of effect image, change the phrase name to
# the name of a file within your Graphics\Pictures folder. Leave out the file
# name extension out of phrase. For ellipitical selection type.
# 
# <area blend: x>
# If you want your area image to use a different blend type, change x to the
# proper blend value. 0 for normal. 1 for additive. 2 for subtractive. For
# ellipitical selection type.
# 
# <area column: x>
# For those who want an entire column (vertical) of enemies to be selected,
# use this tag. x will determine the amount of pixels both ways to offer
# targets for selection. Note that area of effect targetting does not apply to
# Lunatic Mode to maintain custom control. You'll have to manually enter it in
# if you wish for area of effect targetting. Selection typical is rectangular.
# 
# <area row: x>
# For those who want an entire row (horizontal) of enemies to be selected,
# use this tag. x will determine the amount of pixels both ways to offer
# targets for selection. Note that area of effect targetting does not apply to
# Lunatic Mode to maintain custom control. You'll have to manually enter it in
# if you wish for area of effect targetting. Selection typical is rectangular.
# 
# <area map>
# This will select the entire map area for valid enemies. This is pretty much
# the same thing as selecting all enemies or all allies, but offers a visual
# representation of the selection area instead. Note that area of effect
# targetting does not apply to Lunatic Mode to maintain custom control. You'll
# have to manually enter it in if you wish for area of effect targetting.
# Selection typical is rectangular.
# 
# <rect image: phrase>
# Those that want to change the area of effect image, change the phrase name to
# the name of a file within your Graphics\Pictures folder. Leave out the file
# name extension out of phrase. For rectangular selection type.
#
# <rect blend: x>
# If you want your rectangle image to use a different blend type, change x to
# the proper blend value. 0 for normal. 1 for additive. 2 for subtractive. For
# rectangular selection type.
# 
# <knock backward: +x> or <knock sideway: +x>
# <knock backward: -x> or <knock sideway: -x>
# This will allow your items and skills to push your enemies (and possibly
# allies) around the screen. This can potentially throw enemies into range of
# area of attack skills and items.
# 
# <knock random side>
# If your skill can knock an enemy towards the side with the sideway tag, you
# can have them go a different direction each hit using this tag. They will
# swing either to the left or right without discrimination.
# 
# <targets: everybody>
# This will target all existing enemies and allies without any discrimination.
# Will not differentiate damage without aid of custom scripts.
# 
# <targets: target all foes>
# Although it targets all foes, it will strike whichever foe was initially
# selected first. Think of it like Final Fantasy 7's Blade Beam.
# 
# <targets: target random foe x>
# This will target the selected foe, and then randomly select x enemy targets
# to attack. This way, there's at least one guaranteed foe.
# 
# <targets: random foes x>
# This will target x random foes, allowing for numbers over 3. However, this
# tag will not activate if the value equals 0.
# 
# <targets: multi foe x>
# This will target the same foe x times, allowing for more than 2 hits on the
# foe with one skill or item. This tag will not activate if the value equals 0.
# 
# <targets: all but user>
# This will target all allies except for the user. This means that the user will
# not benefit from whatever skill or item being performed.
# 
# <targets: target all allies>
# Just like "target all foes", this will target a single ally and then the rest
# making that single ally to be affected first.
# 
# <targets: target random ally x>
# This will target the selected ally, and then randomly select x ally targets
# to affect. This way, there's at least one guaranteed ally.
# 
# <targets: random allies x>
# This will target x random allies, allowing for numbers over 3. However, this
# tag will not activate if the value equals 0.
# 
# <targets: multi ally x>
# This will target the same ally x times, allowing for more than 2 pops on the
# ally with one skill or item. This tag will not activate if the value equals 0.
# 
# <sort targets: true> or <sort targets: false>
# For those with Battle Engine Zealous and don't want a skill to sort the
# targets from left to right screen position, set the tag to true.

# Enemy Tags - Insert the following tags into Enemy noteboxes.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# <offset x: +n> or <offset y: +n>
# <offset x: -n> or <offset y: -n>
# For those that want to center their enemies properly with the area of effect
# images and allow for the right selection calculations, use these tags to
# adjust the x and y offsets of your enemies.
# 
# <unmovable>
# Some enemies need to remain stationary and cannot move or be knocked around
# like statues and whatnot. Place this tag inside of their notebox and they
# will be immune to moving.
