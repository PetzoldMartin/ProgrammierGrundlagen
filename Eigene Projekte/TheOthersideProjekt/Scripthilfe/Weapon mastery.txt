Weapon mastery

<weapon type: n>
# This is the first part of the necessary tags used for the script. The n value
# determines which weapon element to determine the mastery level of the weapon
# being used.
# 
# <weapon skill lv n:m>
# At weapon mastery level n, skill m appears. These are both integers. To add
# more skills, add more of these tags within the same weapon notebox. Note that
# this tag requires the <weapon type: n> tag to be present in the same notebox
# in order for it to have any effect.
# 
# <trait: barehand>
# This will make the weapon count as a barehanded weapon. However, it will not
# use the skills taken from empty weapon, but instead, it'll use its own weapon
# skill list so be sure to fill out the skill list accordingly.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# State Tags - Insert the following tags into State noteboxes.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# <weapon exp m%> or <weapon exp n:m%>
# The first tag causes all weapon exp rates to change to m% rate. If m is 200,
# then weapon exp is gained at 200%. If the second tag is used, only the weapon
# type n will be affected. n is the ID of the weapon type element.
# 
# <weapon level +n> or <weapon level -n>
# If this tag is used, weapon level is raised/lowered by n amount. This is not
# a permanent change, but rather, a temporary change until the state wears off.
# This tag affects all weapons. This effect is stackable.
# 
# <weapon level m: +n> or <weapon level m: -n>
# Just like the above tag, this adjusts the weapon level temporarily. However,
# it will only affect weapon element type m. This effect is stackable.
# 
# <trait: barehand>
# If this state is inside of a state's tag, that actor will have the barehanded
# trait given to it. Note that this will only affect actors and not enemies
# because enemies cannot equip weapons and armours for obvious reasons. Also
# note that the actor must also not have any weapon equipped with the barehand
# elements.
