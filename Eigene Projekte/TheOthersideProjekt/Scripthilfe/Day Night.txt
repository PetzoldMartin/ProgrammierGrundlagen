#_/                           ? Stop Day-to-Night ?
#_/  When [DN_STOP] is inserted into a Map's name (after its given name), the
#_/  Day-to-Night change stops, the timer does not stop however, and if a phase
#_/  is currently active, such as "Night", the tint remains on the map.
#_/  
#_/                 ? Stop Day-to-Night and Time, Cancel Phase ?
#_/  
#_/  When [DN_VOID] is inserted into a Map's name (after its given name), the
#_/  Day-to-Night change stops, the timer is effectively frozen, and if a phase
#_/  is currently active, such as "Night", the tint is reverted back to normal.

#_/                       ? Phase-Specific Encounters ?
#_/  
#_/  When [DN Phase#](Where Phase# refers to the phase. 0 = Noon, 1 = Evening,
#_/   2 = Night, 3 = Morning) is inserted into a specified Troop's "Notes" box 
#_/   in the Troops tab of the database, the specified Troop will only appear
#_/   under those conditions.

#_/                         ? Event Script Functions ?
#_/  The following commands are available using the "Script" item in events.
#_/  
#_/  * stop_daynight
#_/     Day to Night change is stopped.
#_/  
#_/  * start_daynight
#_/     Day to Night change is started.
#_/  
#_/  * get_daynight_name 
#_/     Name of present phase is acquired. This function only works in other
#_/      scripts.
#_/  
#_/  * get_daynight_week (variable_id)
#_/     Appoints the day of the week to the given variable.
#_/  
#_/  * get_daynight_week_name
#_/     Name of the present day is aquired. This function only works in other
#_/      scripts.
#_/  
#_/  * change_daynight_phase(phase, duration, pass_days)
#_/     Changes the current phase to a new one. Handy for Inns and the like.
#_/     Example: change_daynight_phase (3, 1, 1)
#_/       This would make one day pass, change the phase to morning, with a
#_/       duration of one frame. Duration must be set to a minimum of 1.
#_/  
#_/   * transit_daynight_phase(duration)
#_/      Forces the phase to change at the very moment you call this.
#_/       This appears to be bugged. No matter how I've called it, I get errors.
#_/  
#_/   * set_daynight_default(duration)
#_/      Forces the tint of the current phase to reset to the initial phase.
#_/  
#_/   * restore_daynight_phase(duration)
#_/      Forces the tint of the current phase to reset to its normal tint.
