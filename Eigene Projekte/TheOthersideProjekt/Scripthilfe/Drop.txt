Drop

All configuration happens in the note boxes of enemies. If you wish to add
#   a new drop, place this code in a note box for the enemy:
#      \drop[type id, probability]
#        type        : the type, either Item, Weapon, or Armor. Armour is also
#                     accepted.
#        id          : This is the ID of the item, weapon, or armor.
#        probability : This is the probability the item, weapon, or armor will
#                     drop. If you put a % sign after the number, then it will
#                     drop that percentage of the time. If not, then the number
#                     you put here will be the denominator, same as with 
#                     regular drops. The number has to be an integer.
#    EXAMPLES:
#      \drop[Item 1, 65%]
#          This will mean that the item with ID 1 (Potion by default) will drop
#         65% of the time when you kill this enemy.
#      \drop[armor 5, 8]
#          This will mean that the armor with ID 5 (Mithril Shield by default)
#         will drop 1/8 times you kill this enemy.
