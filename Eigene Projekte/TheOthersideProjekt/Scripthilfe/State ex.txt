# Status Tags - Insert the following tags into a State's notebox.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# <animation n>
# This will cause the state to play animation n on the battler. One animation
# can play at a time only so the highest priority state with an animation will
# take effect. Settings can be adjusted below.
# 
# <max stack n>
# This allows your state to stack n times. By default, this value is 1. When a
# state is applied over again, the stack amount increases. If the stack amount
# increases, the effects of that state will also be increased depending on the
# effect and the power of the effect. Tags listed below will make mention of
# which effects are stackable and which aren't.
# 
# <stat +n> <stat -n> <stat n%>
# Replace stat with maxhp, maxmp, atk, def, spi, agi, hit, eva, cri, or odds
# to increase, decrease, or set the base stat to a percentage. This version
# will allow you to exceed to the 200% minimum if you use n%. If you plan on
# using state stacking, it is recommended to use this tag instead of the innate
# rate system for more accurate calculations. Stackable.
# 
# <hp degen n> <hp degen n%> or <mp degen n> <mp degen n%>
# <hp regen n> <hp regen n%> or <mp regen n> <mp regen n%>
# This causes HP or MP to regenerate or degenerate at the end of each turn. If
# the tag is used without a %, the amount is set. Otherwise, the amount will be
# relative to the battler's MaxHP or MP. Stackable.
# 
# <trait: phrase>
# This tag allows you to add special traits to the inflicted battlers. The
# phrase used will cause a different effect. Nonstackable.
#   super guard      - Guarding reduces damage by 4x instead of 2x.
#   pharmacology     - Items used will have double effect.
#   fast attack      - Early turn initiative.
#   dual attack      - Normal attacks hit twice.
#   prevent critical - Criticals cannot occur on battler.
#   half mp cost     - MP skills cost only half.
#   double exp gain  - Inflicted actor gains double exp.
#   auto hp recover  - Inflicted actor gains HP each turn and step.
#   anti hp degen    - HP degen cannot occur on battler.
#   anti hp regen    - HP regen cannot occur on battler.
#   anti mp degen    - MP degen cannot occur on battler.
#   anti mp regen    - MP regen cannot occur on battler.
